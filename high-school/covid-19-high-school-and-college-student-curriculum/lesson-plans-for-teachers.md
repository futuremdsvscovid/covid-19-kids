# Lesson Plans for Teachers

**How to use these lesson plans:** 

Below is the case manual and case lesson plan for you to download if you want to teach this class to your students virtually. We suggest having 2-3 people teaching the simulation if possible -- one to act as a consult, and one to act as the patient. The powerpoint is included so that you can display different lab values, images, or vitals throughout the case. Even if you are unfamiliar with clinical medicine, walking through this curriculum yourself with the guides provided should help you to guide students through the materials as well. Encourage them to research questions that you may not know the answers to, and remind them that learning is a lifelong process - especially during this pandemic! A key part of implementing this curriculum is offering students support and space to process their emotional reactions to this pandemic. We recommend assigning a reflection exercise upon completion of the case and giving students the handout “Caring for Yourself and Others during COVID-19.” 

This lesson has been taught over Zoom with multiple schools in the Boston area, typically taking place over two one-hour sessions, with one teacher acting as a consulting attending, one teacher acting as the patient, and one teacher acting as classroom manager, utilizing the chatbox to engage students, manage breakout rooms, etc. However, it can be taught in as little as one hour if you need to condense it. 

If you would like to discuss the optimal way to implement this curriculum in your classroom, reach out to **jessica\_laird@hms.harvard.edu**. If after reviewing the materials you still feel uncomfortable moderating the case, medical students across the country have been side-lined from clinical duties and are looking for ways to get involved. Consider reaching out to a local medical school and see if they have students who would be interested in guiding this case for your students. Contact **jessica\_laird@hms.harvard.edu** for more info and visit [https://covidstudentresponse.org/resources/taskforce-database/](https://covidstudentresponse.org/resources/taskforce-database/) to connect with other medical student-led outreach groups.
