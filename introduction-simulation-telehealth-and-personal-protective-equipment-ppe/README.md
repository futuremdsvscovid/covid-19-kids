# High School and College Learning Modules

You are about to learn some of the basics of clinical medicine and meet your patient, Bob. We encourage students to take notes as you go, and record your answers to the check-in quizzes as you work through them. The quiz questions are intended to help you learn, and there are extra resources included in some of the answers for you to explore if you are interested. You are welcome to repeat the quizzes more than once to assist you in your learning.
