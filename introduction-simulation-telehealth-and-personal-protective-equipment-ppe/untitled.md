## **Instructions:** 

It’s time to meet our patient, Bob! Below is the transcript of your interview with him in the Emergency Department. You’re going to be asked to think like a doctor here to help diagnose and treat this patient!

## **The Interview**

When you are interviewing a patient, you need to collect a lot of key information:  ****

* **Who are they?**
  * Name, age, gender 
* **What is their overall health like?** 
  * Past medical history -- any diseases or medical problems they currently have or had in the past
  * Past surgical history -- any surgeries they’ve had 
  * Medications 
  * Allergies 
  * Family history -- any diseases that run in the family
  * Social history -- What is their life like? Do they work? Where do they live and in what type of conditions? Who do they live with? Do they drink, smoke or use drugs? 
    * This helps us understand potential causes of their medical condition, as well as develop a treatment plan with the patient that is compatible with their lifestyle. 
* **Why are they here today?** 
  * Chief complaint -- What is the \#1 problem that brought them into the hospital today?
  * History of present illness -- the storyline behind this problem that brought them into the hospital

**Student Doctor \(You\):** I heard you’re not feeling so well. What brings you into the clinic? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I’ve been having a hard time breathing. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Can you tell me more about that? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** It started about a week ago and keeps getting worse. I also think I’ve had a fever. I’ve been coughing and feeling really tired. I don’t know how I got sick because I don’t know anyone around me who has been sick. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** What is your health normally like? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I have a lung disease called COPD \(more on this in the next section\) and it affects my life a lot. I usually get a little short of breath when climbing stairs or walking long distances, and cough every day because of my COPD. However, I noticed I am much more short of breath than normal and have been coughing a lot more. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do you have any other health problems? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I also have high blood pressure. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Have you ever had surgery before? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I had my appendix removed 40 years ago. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do you take any medications? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I take a pill for my high blood pressure and use some inhalers for my COPD. I don’t know the names. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do you have any allergies? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** No.

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do any diseases run in your family? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** My father had a heart attack and my mom had cancer.

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Can you tell me about your day-to-day life? ****

**Bob \(Patient\):** I am retired -- I used to work in construction but can’t anymore because of my breathing issues. I live alone in an apartment in Boston. In the last 2 weeks, I have had a few doctor's appointments and had to go to the pharmacy to pick up medications a few times, as well as go to the grocery store. I used to smoke cigarettes and smoked 2 packs of cigarettes a day for 35 years, but I quit 10 years ago. I do not drink alcohol or use other drugs.

## Physical Exam

**Nurse Morgan:** Would you like me to perform a physical exam on the patient? ****

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Yes please. Could you pay extra attention to how the lungs sound?

**Nurse Morgan:** Most of the physical exam was normal, however, the lungs do not sound clear. Here are the sounds I’m hearing in the lungs: 

[**Crackles**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHqqvrm2j6g) **and** [**Wheezing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4qNgi4Vrvo) ****

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Thank you so much. What are the patient’s vital signs? ****

**Nurse Morgan:** 

|  | **Heart Rate \(beats per minute\)** | **Blood Pressure** | **Temperature** | **Oxygen saturation** | **Respiratory Rate \(breaths per minute\)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Patient | 95 | 120/70 | 102F | 85% | 25 |
| Normal | 60-100 | 110-140/60-80 | 98.6F | 95-100% | 12-20 |

### **Key:**

**Heart rate -** also known as the pulse. How many times your heart beats a minute.

**Blood pressure -** the pressure in your blood vessels when the heart is squeezing \(number on top= systolic blood pressure\) and when the heart is relaxed \(number on bottom= diastolic blood pressure\). 

**Temperature -** body temperature ****

**Oxygen saturation -** percent of hemoglobin \(protein in blood that binds oxygen\) that is currently carrying oxygen 

**Respiratory rate -** how many times you breathe in a minute
