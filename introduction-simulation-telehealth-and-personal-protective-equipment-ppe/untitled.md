# Case Part 1: The Man who Lost His Breath

## **Instructions:** 

It’s time to meet our patient, Bob! Below is the transcript of your interview with him in the Emergency Department. You’re going to be asked to think like a doctor here to help diagnose and treat this patient!

## **The Interview**

When you are interviewing a patient, you need to collect a lot of key information:  ****

* **Who are they?**
  * Name, age, gender 
* **What is their overall health like?** 
  * Past medical history -- any diseases or medical problems they currently have or had in the past
  * Past surgical history -- any surgeries they’ve had 
  * Medications 
  * Allergies 
  * Family history -- any diseases that run in the family
  * Social history -- What is their life like? Do they work? Where do they live and in what type of conditions? Who do they live with? Do they drink, smoke or use drugs? 
    * This helps us understand potential causes of their medical condition, as well as develop a treatment plan with the patient that is compatible with their lifestyle. 
* **Why are they here today?** 
  * Chief complaint -- What is the \#1 problem that brought them into the hospital today?
  * History of present illness -- the storyline behind this problem that brought them into the hospital

**Student Doctor \(You\):** I heard you’re not feeling so well. What brings you into the clinic? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I’ve been having a hard time breathing. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Can you tell me more about that? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** It started about a week ago and keeps getting worse. I also think I’ve had a fever. I’ve been coughing and feeling really tired. I don’t know how I got sick because I don’t know anyone around me who has been sick. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** What is your health normally like? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I have a lung disease called COPD \(more on this in the next section\) and it affects my life a lot. I usually get a little short of breath when climbing stairs or walking long distances, and cough every day because of my COPD. However, I noticed I am much more short of breath than normal and have been coughing a lot more. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do you have any other health problems? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I also have high blood pressure. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Have you ever had surgery before? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I had my appendix removed 40 years ago. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do you take any medications? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** I take a pill for my high blood pressure and use some inhalers for my COPD. I don’t know the names. 

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do you have any allergies? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** No.

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Do any diseases run in your family? 

**Bob \(Patient\):** My father had a heart attack and my mom had cancer.

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Can you tell me about your day-to-day life? ****

**Bob \(Patient\):** I am retired -- I used to work in construction but can’t anymore because of my breathing issues. I live alone in an apartment in Boston. In the last 2 weeks, I have had a few doctor's appointments and had to go to the pharmacy to pick up medications a few times, as well as go to the grocery store. I used to smoke cigarettes and smoked 2 packs of cigarettes a day for 35 years, but I quit 10 years ago. I do not drink alcohol or use other drugs.

## Physical Exam

**Nurse Morgan:** Would you like me to perform a physical exam on the patient? ****

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Yes please. Could you pay extra attention to how the lungs sound?

**Nurse Morgan:** Most of the physical exam was normal, however, the lungs do not sound clear. Here are the sounds I’m hearing in the lungs: 

[**Crackles**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHqqvrm2j6g) **and** [**Wheezing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4qNgi4Vrvo) ****

**Student Doctor \(You\):** Thank you so much. What are the patient’s vital signs? ****

**Nurse Morgan:** 

|  | **Heart Rate \(beats per minute\)** | **Blood Pressure** | **Temperature** | **Oxygen saturation** | **Respiratory Rate \(breaths per minute\)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Patient | 95 | 120/70 | 102F | 85% | 25 |
| Normal | 60-100 | 110-140/60-80 | 98.6F | 95-100% | 12-20 |

### **Key:**

**Heart rate -** also known as the pulse. How many times your heart beats a minute.

**Blood pressure -** the pressure in your blood vessels when the heart is squeezing \(number on top= systolic blood pressure\) and when the heart is relaxed \(number on bottom= diastolic blood pressure\). 

**Temperature -** body temperature ****

**Oxygen saturation -** percent of hemoglobin \(protein in blood that binds oxygen\) that is currently carrying oxygen 

**Respiratory rate -** how many times you breathe in a minute

## Learning Point: What is COPD?

### **Have you heard of COPD? What does it stand for? What is it caused by?**  

* COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.
* COPD is a combination of emphysema \(destroyed lung tissue\) and chronic bronchitis \(long-term lung airway inflammation\).
* COPD is almost always caused by smoking.  ****

#### **What is the anatomy of the respiratory system?**

* Mouth/nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli 
* For more information, here is a [Khan Academy video reviewing the respiratory system. ](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-human-body-systems/hs-the-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/v/the-lungs-and-pulmonary-system)

### **What is the normal function of the alveoli?** 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/APzvW99fe-M-HmeYkaCGZ5gclAIUfYTWU5IgQhNWIVwoA-Tqt6MtdlycO3sw2eI8aQv9rlmcEV8dOhnux_hllaCFjhU4NjKQPNsSUmZJ72sANPQwjlj0aMNMfFOWYypqJgXfF9wN)

* Just like balloons, the walls of alveoli are stretchy and elastic so that they can expand when you inhale and then deflate when you exhale. They are gathered together like a bunch of grapes and are surrounded by blood vessels. They have thin walls that allow gas to pass into and out of the bloodstream. This is how you get oxygen \(O2\) into the body and carbon dioxide \(CO2\) out.

### **How does smoking affect the alveoli? \(Emphysema\)**

* The toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke destroy the alveoli. 
* Smoking makes the alveoli less stretchy, causing air to get trapped. 
  * Inflammation from the smoke destroys the protein in the alveolus that makes it stretchy and elastic, called “elastin.” Since the alveoli can no longer spring back after being filled with air, air gets trapped in the alveoli. This traps CO2 in your lungs, and when you take your next breath, you can’t bring in as much new oxygen. 
* Smoking makes the walls of the alveoli thick, so oxygen cannot travel across them well. 
* Smoking eventually destroys the alveoli so the lung is made up of large holes rather than healthy lung tissue.   ****

### **How does the body prevent bacteria and dust that you normally breathe in from infecting your lungs?** 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_j24dyX_rJmGW-jn5LcGOvjxM0dOvF--nhDZ7PeJuZUw5K9mi5-imO_m2hT7KxvpWKkLSMcazTMLKwyMMpZnOBUubwHTtigIVtQzyUstTwRPKmdqYRGmshm4gsGMZhqsgfgETfUY)

* Your body produces sticky mucus that can trap invading bacteria or inhaled dust  and prevent it from getting deeper into your lung tissue. 
* It then has to get rid of the mucus. One group of airways, called the bronchi, have little finger-like projections, called “cilia,” that move the mucus up into the trachea so that you can swallow it or cough it up. This system of mucus + cilia is sometimes called the “mucociliary escalator” \(see the picture above!\) 

### **How does smoking affect the bronchi? \(Chronic Bronchitis\)**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/l9cHmcs0x9DqqHaKsDe0GZFQdWUai4RzLxW9CctnDM0_jJnasgpXM-ktPgeOxVfsRD_ziCbcBYC0K_KSssMHWRY6Kfi_8Ln7nnTlrxgvaHxteGghG3NIk6xpq9sdi_7zz6GRjJKP)

Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/images/bronchitis-lg.jpg)

* Smoking destroys the cilia and increases mucus production. This is why one of the symptoms of COPD is coughing with mucus. It’s harder to clear bacteria and easier for them to get into the lungs, which is why patients with COPD have frequent lung infections \(pneumonias\). 
* Smoking also decreases the diameter of the bronchi so that it’s harder to get air in. This is a combination of increased mucus inside the bronchi as well as inflammation causing the walls of the bronchi to thicken, so there is less room for air to flow to the alveoli for gas exchange. 

### **Why is our patient more susceptible to a severe lung infection?** 

* COPD 
  * Lungs are not able to clear infection as well.
  * Lungs at baseline are not working well. A person with healthy lungs can have a lot of their lung tissue temporarily not work, but still be able to breathe and maintain a normal oxygen saturation.  This is because the rest of their lungs are working well and are able to bring in enough oxygen for the body. A person with unhealthy lungs does not have the reserve to take on this extra challenge, and may need mechanical help to continue breathing.   
* Age - our immune system is not as strong as we get older.
