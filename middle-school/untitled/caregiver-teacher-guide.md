# Caregiver/Teacher Guide

## **Introduction:**

This curriculum is designed to help middle-schoolers learn more about COVID-19 in an interactive and educational way. Beyond helping to increase their knowledge, it is designed to get them excited about the scientific process, a method that is on full display during this time of uncertainty and discovery.

### **How to Use This Curriculum:**

Kids can work through this curriculum on their own or in partnership with their caregivers/teachers. The curriculum is split into two parts: Part 1 - Building Background Knowledge and Part 2 - Action and Exploration. Students can complete the whole curriculum all in one sitting or split the two parts over multiple days. There is a worksheet \(that can be downloaded or printed out\) that children should fill out as they move through the curriculum in order to get the most out of the material:

**For teachers -** the worksheet can be used as an assignment to show that your students completed the module. Students can also create a Prezi or Google Slides presentation about their Scientific Method discovery question to share with the class as a culminating project. 

**For parents and caregivers -** the worksheet is a good tool to use to get a sense of how your child is feeling during this uncertain time. Further tools for beginning this discussion can be found on the guide linked below. In particular, The Wellness Societyâ€™s [Coronavirus Anxiety Workbook](https://thewellnesssociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Coronavirus-Anxiety-Workbook.pdf) is a great resource filled with interactive strategies to reduce stress. 

### **Managing Worry and Stress:**

This can be a very stressful time for children and caregivers, alike. Focusing on family mental health can help us support one another. Check out our guide for caregivers:
