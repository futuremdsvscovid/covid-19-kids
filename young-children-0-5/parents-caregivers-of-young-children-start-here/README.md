## Introduction

Everyone has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be particularly difficult to take care of a young child while facing numerous other challenges. It is okay if you are not doing everything perfectly “right” during this time. This guide hopes to provide some foundational guidance and links to a variety of resources which you may find useful. It is not meant to offer professional or medical advice. As always, you should reach out to your child’s doctor if you have concerns about your child.

Here, you will find [tips for new parents](for-new-parents.md), suggestions for [managing daily routines](managing-the-day-to-day.md), ways to [support your child's development](supporting-your-young-childs-development.md), tips for [stress management and resilience-building](stress-management-and-resiliency-building.md) for you and your child, ideas for [activities to do together,](activities.md) and strategies to[ address your child’s questions about COVID-19](what-should-i-tell-my-child-about-covid-19.md). Every child, every parent/caregiver, and every family is unique. We encourage you to decide for yourself which suggestions best fit your family’s individual needs and what will allow you to parent at your best \(even if it’s not “the best”\) during this time.

Our [References](references.md) and [Additional Resources](additional-resources.md) pages list sources consulted \(ordered by section and subsection\), as well as additional resources you may find helpful.
