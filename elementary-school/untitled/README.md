## Who is this curriculum for?

This section contains two series of modules: one for grades 1-3, and one for grades 4-6. Both will guide students through interactive coloring pages, which are linked throughout the materials and as printable pdf's below. Children can work through the website and pages on their own, or teachers/parents can use the guide on the next page to work through it with them.
