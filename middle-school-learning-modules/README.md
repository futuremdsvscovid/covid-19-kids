# Middle School Learning Modules

## **Introduction:**

You’ve been hearing a lot about the coronavirus lately. Maybe you’ve even heard these other words too, like: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and pandemic.

And you may have some questions like: What is a virus anyway? Why do people get sick? Why can’t we go to school? And most importantly, how can I help? 

We’ve heard your questions and put together an interactive website to help answer your questions, as well as get you thinking about other questions that we don’t know the answers to yet. After all, science is all about discovery. 

Please download or print out the COVID-19 worksheet and complete it as you go through the module:
